## 📦 Prerequisites for Testing (User Actions Required)

Before testing can begin, the user must manually:

1. ✅ **Update Users Sheet** - Add columns:
   - Column B: `Password`
   - Column C: `First_Name`
   - Column D: `Last_Name`
   - (Keep existing: Role, Company_Name, Active)

2. ✅ **Create Comments Sheet** - New sheet with columns:
   - `Comment_ID` | `Lead_ID` | `User_Email` | `User_Name` | `Created_At` | `Comment_Text`

3. ✅ **Update Leads Sheet** - Add columns at end:
   - `Accepted_By`
   - `Completed_By`
   - `Cancelled_By`

4. ⏳ **Add Test User** - Manually add a user to Users sheet:
   - Email: your@email.com
   - Password: (use hash generator function)
   - First_Name: Your
   - Last_Name: Name
   - Role: Admin
   - Company_Name: Dev Company
   - Active: TRUE

## 💡 Technical Notes

### Password Hashing
- Uses SHA-256 via Apps Script `Utilities.computeDigest()`
- Passwords stored as 64-character hexadecimal strings
- Cannot be reversed to plain text
- Same password always produces same hash

### Session Storage
- Stored in browser `localStorage`
- Key: `engage_user_session`
- Contains: email, firstName, lastName, fullName, role, companyName, active
- Persists across page reloads
- Cleared on logout

### User Badge Colors
- Generated deterministically from initials
- 8 distinct colors for visual variety
- Same initials always get same color

### Real-time Polling Integration
- Polling continues to work with authentication
- User email passed to all status update operations
- Ownership tracking happens automatically on status changes
