# 📞 Call Type Selector - Improved Form Flow

## Overview

The intake form now has a **top-level call type selector** that intelligently shows/hides fields based on whether it's a **New Sale** or **Service Call**. This dramatically improves agent workflow and data quality.

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before
- Single "Reason for Call" dropdown with mixed options
- Service selection always required (even for service calls)
- Confusing workflow for non-sales calls

### After
- **Two distinct call types**: New Sale vs Service Call
- Smart form that adapts to call type
- Service selection only required for new sales
- Clear, purpose-driven workflows

1. **New Sale → Service:**
   - Service grid hides
   - Selected service clears

2. **Service → New Sale:**

   - Notes label changes to "Call Notes & Details"

**Toast notifications** confirm the mode switch.

## 📊 Data Storage

### ✅ NO New Spreadsheet Columns Needed!

Uses existing columns with prefixed values:

| Column | New Sale Example | Service Call Example |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Reason_For_Call** | "New Sale - Initial Purchase" | "Service - Billing Question" |
| **Reason_Custom** | "" (empty) | "Charged twice this month" |
| **Product_SKU** | "HPP_Q_001" | "" (empty) |
| **Product_Name** | "Home Protection Plan" | "" (empty) |
| **Initial_Price** | 225.00 | 0 |
| **Recurring_Price** | 55.00 | 0 |
| **sq_ft** | 5000 | 0 |
| **Lead_Value** | 225.00 | 0 |

**Dashboard Compatibility:** Existing dashboards will show the prefixed reason (e.g., "New Sale - Initial Purchase") with no changes needed.
