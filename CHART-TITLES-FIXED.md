# Chart Titles Corrected - Data/Label Alignment ✅

## Issue Identified
Chart titles didn't accurately describe the data being displayed, causing confusion.

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. **"Revenue Funnel" → "Lead Pipeline Status"**

**Problem:** 
- Title said "Revenue Funnel" 
- Chart actually showed **lead counts** by status (NEW, ACCEPTED, COMPLETED)
- No revenue calculation involved

**Fix:**
```
OLD: Revenue Funnel
NEW: Lead Pipeline Status
```

**Data Shown:**
- Counts of leads at each stage (NEW, ACCEPTED, COMPLETED)
- Visual bar chart showing pipeline progression
- Helps identify where leads get stuck

**Updated Description:**
> Counts leads by status (NEW, ACCEPTED, COMPLETED) from the Leads sheet. Shows how many leads are at each stage of your pipeline to identify bottlenecks.

---

### 2. **"Peak Hours Analysis" → "Call Reason Distribution"**

**Problem:**
- Title said "Peak Hours Analysis"
- Chart actually showed **call volume by reason** (New Sale, Service Call, etc.)
- No time/hour analysis involved

**Fix:**
```
OLD: Peak Hours Analysis
     Peak: Unknown
NEW: Call Reason Distribution
     Most Common: Unknown
```

**Data Shown:**
- Counts of leads grouped by Reason_For_Call field
- Shows most common types of calls (Initial Purchase, Service Call, etc.)
- Helps identify primary customer needs

**Updated Description:**
> Groups leads by Reason_For_Call field (e.g., "New Sale - Initial Purchase", "Service Call"). Shows call volume by reason to identify most common customer needs and staffing requirements.

**JavaScript Update:**
```javascript
// OLD
$('#peakHour').textContent = `Top: ${topReason[0]} (${topReason[1]} leads)`;

// NEW
$('#peakHour').textContent = `Most Common: ${topReason[0]} (${topReason[1]} leads)`;
```

### 3. **"Lead Conversion Timeline" → "Lead Status Distribution"**

**Problem:**
- Title said "Lead Conversion Timeline"
- Chart actually showed **status counts** in a bar chart (not a timeline)
- No time-based progression shown

**Fix:**
```
OLD: Lead Conversion Timeline
     Avg: 0 days
NEW: Lead Status Distribution
     Completion Rate: 0%
```

**Data Shown:**
- Bar chart showing count of leads for each status (NEW, ACCEPTED, COMPLETED, CANCELLED)
- Same data as "Lead Pipeline Status" but different visualization
- Completion rate percentage calculated

**Updated Description:**
> Counts leads by Status field (NEW, ACCEPTED, COMPLETED, CANCELLED). Shows current pipeline distribution and calculates completion rate percentage for performance tracking.

**Note:** The JavaScript already correctly showed "Completion: X%" so no code change was needed here.

| **Lead Pipeline Status** | Lead counts by status (NEW, ACCEPTED, COMPLETED) | Bar Chart |
| **Lead Sources** | Distribution of lead origins (currently all Call Center) | Pie Chart |
| **Geographic Distribution** | Lead counts by state | Bar Chart |
| **Service Performance** | Revenue per service (COMPLETED leads only) | Column Chart |

## ✅ Verification

**Before:**
- ❌ "Revenue Funnel" suggested money flow (but showed lead counts)
- ❌ "Peak Hours" suggested time analysis (but showed call reasons)
- ❌ "Timeline" suggested time progression (but showed status breakdown)

**After:**
- ✅ "Lead Pipeline Status" accurately describes lead stage counts
- ✅ "Call Reason Distribution" accurately describes reason-based grouping
- ✅ "Lead Status Distribution" accurately describes status breakdown
