# 📅 Scheduling Field Implementation

## Overview

The intake form now captures **what scheduling commitment was told to the customer** for all leads.

---

## ✅ What Was Added

### Scheduling Told Field

**Location:** Call Details section  
**Required:** Yes, for all call types  
**Type:** Dropdown with predefined options

**Options Available:**
- Today Afternoon (12-4 PM)
- Tomorrow Morning (8-12 PM)
- Tomorrow Afternoon (12-4 PM)
- Tomorrow (Anytime)
- Other - See Notes

---

## 🎯 Based on Your Scheduling Plan

From your Oct 6, 2025 call notes:

**Commitment Windows:**
- **Before 12:00 PM** → Offer: Today afternoon OR tomorrow
- **After 3:00 PM** → Offer: Tomorrow morning OR tomorrow afternoon
- **Reservice calls** → ASAP (same "today or tomorrow" posture)
- **Snake removal** → Urgent booking with up-front payment

**Agent Script:**
> "We can get a technician out [TODAY AFTERNOON / TOMORROW MORNING]. Which works better? I'll note your preference now, and once we assign your tech, our CSR will call to confirm the exact time."

html += `
  <div class="scheduling-section">
    <h3>📅 Scheduling</h3>
    <p><strong>Told Customer:</strong> ${lead.Scheduling_Told}</p>
  </div>
