# Development Environment Setup - SUMMARY

## ✅ Completed Automatically

### 1. Git Branch Structure
- ✅ Created `development` branch
- ✅ Pushed to remote repository
- ✅ `main` branch updated with infrastructure files
- ✅ Both branches configured and ready

### 2. Configuration Files
- ✅ Created `frontend-shared/config.production.js` (production settings)
- ✅ Created `frontend-shared/config.staging.js` (staging settings - needs URL update)
- ✅ Both files present in both branches

### 3. Environment Detection
- ✅ Updated `frontend-intake/index-cyberpunk-v2.html` with auto-detection
- ✅ Updated `frontend-intake/index.html` with auto-detection  
- ✅ Updated `frontend-dashboard/index.html` with auto-detection
- ✅ Detection logic supports:
  - Automatic detection on localhost (uses staging)
  - Manual override with `?env=staging` URL parameter
  - Production as default on zakpestsos.github.io

### 4. Apps Script Configuration
- ✅ Updated `.clasp.json` with deployment references
- ✅ Created `generate-dev-token.gs` helper script (needs clasp push)

### 5. Documentation
- ✅ Created `DEV-WORKFLOW.md` - Complete development workflow guide
- ✅ Created `DEV-ENVIRONMENT-SETUP.md` - Step-by-step setup instructions
- ✅ Created this summary document

## 🔧 Manual Steps Required

### Step 1: Push Helper Script to Apps Script

```bash
# Authenticate with clasp (if needed)
clasp login

# Push the new helper script
clasp push
```

This will upload `generate-dev-token.gs` to your Apps Script project.

### Step 2: Create Staging Apps Script Deployment

**📖 Detailed instructions in: DEV-ENVIRONMENT-SETUP.md**

Quick steps:
1. Open Apps Script: `clasp open`
2. Deploy → New Deployment → Web App
3. Description: "Staging Environment"
4. Execute as: Me
5. Who has access: Anyone
6. Copy the staging deployment URL

### Step 3: Update Staging Config

Edit `frontend-shared/config.staging.js` on the `development` branch:

```javascript
API_BASE: 'YOUR_STAGING_DEPLOYMENT_URL_HERE',
```

Then commit:
```bash
git checkout development
git add frontend-shared/config.staging.js
git commit -m "Setup: Add staging deployment URL"
git push origin development
```

### Step 4: Create Dev Company

**Option A: Automated (Recommended)**
1. Open Apps Script: `clasp open`
2. Select function: `setupDevCompany`
3. Click Run
4. Copy the Dev Company token from the log

**Option B: Manual**
1. Run `generateDevToken()` function in Apps Script
2. Manually add company to "Companies" sheet
3. Manually add test products to "Products" sheet

**📖 Detailed instructions in: DEV-ENVIRONMENT-SETUP.md**

### Step 5: Test Everything

1. Test staging backend:
   ```bash
   curl "YOUR_STAGING_URL?test=ping"
   ```

2. Test staging frontend locally:
   - Switch to development branch
   - Open HTML files locally (auto-uses staging config)
   - Submit a test form with Dev Company
   - Verify data in spreadsheet

3. Verify production unchanged:
   - Visit: https://zakpestsos.github.io/engage-intake/
   - Should work exactly as before
   - Should use production deployment

## 🎯 Current Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Git Branches | ✅ Complete | main & development both pushed |
| Config Files | ⚠️ Partial | Staging URL needs to be added |
| HTML Updates | ✅ Complete | Auto-detection working |
| Apps Script Helper | ⚠️ Pending | Needs `clasp push` |
| Staging Deployment | ❌ Pending | User must create in Apps Script |
| Dev Company | ❌ Pending | User must add to spreadsheet |
| Documentation | ✅ Complete | All guides created |

## 🚀 Quick Start (After Manual Steps)

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Start working
git checkout development
git pull

# Make changes
# Test locally (auto-uses staging)

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Feature: description"
git push origin development

# Deploy to production (when ready)
git checkout main
git merge development
git push origin main
```

### Testing Locally

```bash
# Switch to development branch
git checkout development

# Open any HTML file in browser
# It will automatically use staging config on localhost
```

### Force Staging Mode

Add `?env=staging` to any URL to force staging config:
```
https://zakpestsos.github.io/engage-intake/frontend-intake/?env=staging
```

## 📚 Documentation Reference

1. **DEV-ENVIRONMENT-SETUP.md** - Complete setup guide with detailed instructions
2. **DEV-WORKFLOW.md** - Daily development procedures and best practices
3. **SETUP-SUMMARY.md** - This file, quick reference of what's done

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Production Safety
- ✅ Main branch is still fully functional
- ✅ Production users NOT affected by these changes
- ✅ All changes are additive (nothing removed or broken)
- ✅ HTML files default to production config on GitHub Pages

### What Changed on Production
- Added environment detection (but defaults to production)
- Added config.production.js (production settings unchanged)
- Added config.staging.js (for reference, not used in production)
- Added documentation files

### What's Safe to Use Now
- Development branch is ready for work
- HTML files work with environment detection
- You can start developing on `development` branch

### What Needs Completion
- Staging Apps Script deployment
- Dev Company in spreadsheet
- Update config.staging.js with staging URL
