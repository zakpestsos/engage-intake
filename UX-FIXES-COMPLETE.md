**Solution:** Implemented side-by-side modal positioning

### Changes Made:
- **Lead Modal**: Now shifts to the left (25% from left) when comments modal opens
- **Comments Modal**: Positioned fixed on the right side (5% from right)
- Both modals use smooth transitions for elegant movement
- When lead modal closes, comments modal automatically closes too

### CSS Changes:
- Added `.modal-content.with-comments` class for shifted positioning

- Proper spacing for modal fields (`0.75rem`)

## 🎯 Issue #3: Add User Button Styling - FIXED ✅

## 🎯 Issue #4: User Management Visibility - FIXED ✅

**Problem:** User Management section showing on Leads page  
**Solution:** Added `!important` to display rules

### Changes Made:
```css
#usersSection {
  display: none !important;
}

#usersSection.active {
  display: block !important;
}
```

Now the section is properly hidden when not on Users tab.

## 🎯 Issue #5: Assigned To Dropdown - FIXED ✅

**Problem 1:** Clicking dropdown opened lead modal  
**Solution:** Added event propagation stopping

**Problem 2:** Dropdown was empty (no users)  
**Solution:** Fixed user loading order and rendering

### Changes Made:

#### Event Propagation Fix:
- Added click event listener with `stopPropagation()` on `.assign-dropdown`
- Prevents row click from firing when interacting with dropdown
- Also prevents clicks on `.assigned-cell` from bubbling up

#### User Loading Fix:
- Modified `loadAllUsers()` to only render table if on users section
- Prevents errors during initialization
- Added console logging: `✅ Loaded X users for dropdown`
- Users are loaded BEFORE `renderLeads()` is called
- `allUsers` array is properly populated for dropdown generation
