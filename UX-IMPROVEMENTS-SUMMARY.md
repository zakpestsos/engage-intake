## üéØ Issues Fixed

### 1. Internal Notes Modal - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Internal Notes was cramped inside the lead modal  
**Solution:** Created a separate, beautiful modal for Internal Notes

**Changes:**
- Removed comments sidebar from inside lead modal
- Added a button "üí¨ View Internal Notes (0)" at the bottom of lead details
- Created a new separate modal that slides in from the right when button is clicked
- Comments modal has its own dedicated space with better readability
- Added smooth slide-in animation for better UX

### 2. User Loading Error (Forbidden) - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Problem:** "Failed to Load Users: Forbidden" error  
**Solution:** Fixed API calls to use JSONP

**Changes:**
- Updated `loadAllUsers()` to use `fetchJSON()` instead of `fetch()`
- Updated `loadCommentsForLead()` to use `fetchJSON()` as well
- Now properly handles cross-origin requests via JSONP

### 3. User Icon Color Customization - ADDED ‚úÖ
**Problem:** No way to edit user icon color  
**Solution:** Added color picker to user management

**Changes:**
- Added color picker input in user creation/edit form
- Backend now stores `Icon_Color` in Users sheet
- All user avatars/badges now use custom colors if set
- Default color is `#3b82f6` (blue) if not set
- Color picker has beautiful hover effects

### 4. User Management Display Issue - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Problem:** User Management showing on wrong page (below Lead Management)  
**Solution:** Fixed CSS to properly hide/show sections

**Changes:**
- Added CSS rule: `#usersSection { display: none; }`
- Only shows when `usersSection.active` class is applied
- Now properly displays only when Users tab is clicked

### 5. Assigned To Column - ADDED ‚úÖ
**Problem:** No way to assign leads to users  
**Solution:** Added "Assigned To" column with dropdown selector

**Changes:**
- Added "Assigned To" column in leads table

- Shows user avatar badge next to dropdown when assigned
- Real-time assignment updates via API
- Backend function `updateLeadAssignment_()` handles assignment updates

## üìã What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Update Google Sheet Structure

You need to add two new columns to your sheets:

#### A. Users Sheet
Add column: **`Icon_Color`** (should be the 8th column)

**Columns should be:**
1. Email
2. Password
3. First_Name
4. Last_Name
5. Role
6. Company_Name
7. Active
8. **Icon_Color** ‚Üê NEW

#### B. Leads Sheet  
This may already exist, but ensure you have: **`Assigned_To`** column

The column should be in the LEADS_HEADERS array (already updated in backend).

### Step 2: Update Apps Script Staging Deployment

Since you made backend changes, you need to push them to Apps Script:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd C:\Users\dvssh\OneDrive\Documents\Engage

# Push to Apps Script
clasp push

# Then in Apps Script Editor:
# 1. Open https://script.google.com
# 2. Find your "Leads CRM (Apps Script)" project
# 3. Click "Deploy" ‚Üí "Manage Deployments"
# 4. Find your STAGING deployment
# 5. Click the pencil icon (Edit)
# 6. Under "Version", select "New version"
# 7. Click "Deploy"
```

### Step 3: Clear Browser Cache & Test

```
1. Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Open: http://localhost:8000/frontend-dashboard/index.html?token=615e0a2323760bf9995c10b7c7ec44f8
3. Login with: zak@pest-sos.com / admin123
